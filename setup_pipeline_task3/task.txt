Task 1: Install Elasticsearch on a Linux Server using Ansible

    Goal: Write an Ansible playbook to install Elasticsearch on a Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).

    Steps:

        Install Java (if necessary, as Elasticsearch requires it).

        Add the Elasticsearch package repository to your system.

        Install Elasticsearch using the package manager (e.g., apt for Ubuntu or yum for CentOS).

        Configure Elasticsearch settings (e.g., cluster name, node settings) via the elasticsearch.yml file.

        Start and enable Elasticsearch to run on system boot.

        Verify the Elasticsearch service is running and accessible on port 9200.
